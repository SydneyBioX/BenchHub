## About 

BenchHub is a data storage framework to facilitate living benchmarkâ€‹s. It aims to enhance reproducibility and accessibility of benchmarking studies by making it easier to store, analyse and share benchmarking data.  

The two components currently in BenchHub are:  
- **Trio**: A data structure consisting of Dataset, Auxiliary and Metric to faciliate the sharing of benchmarking datasets within the community.    
- **BenchmarkInsight**: A data structure for storing benchmarking results and provides a collection of visualisations to faciliate the analysis of benchmarking results. 


### Trio


Trio is built around three key components:

Dataset: Data used by the methods to generate output.   
Auxiliary Data: Metadata to compare with the output of methods, such as cell type, patient outcome, disease pathway.      
Metric: Evaluation metrics used to compare output of methods with auxiliary data.

Trio is implemented as R6 object with fields to store each of the components.

### BenchmarkInsight 

BenchmarkInsight serves as a visualisation and analysis tool for benchmarking results. It contains multiple visualisation techniques to help researchers analyse benchmarking results in terms of data, methods and metrics.
